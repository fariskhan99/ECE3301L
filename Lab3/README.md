âœ… Lab Tasks

- LED Blinking â€“ Implement a delay subroutine to flash LEDs and verify timing with a logic analyzer.  

- Switch to LED Mapping â€“ Read input from switches (PORTA) and display values on LEDs (PORTB).  

- RGB LED Control â€“ Extend logic to control an RGB LED on PORTC.  

- Color Cycling Loop â€“ Use counters and delays to cycle through 8 RGB patterns.  

- Array-Based Sequences â€“ Store color arrays in memory and use indirect addressing (FSR/INDF) to drive two RGB LEDs, verified via logic analyzer.  

ðŸ”‘ Key Skills

- Setting up Assembly projects in MPLAB X.  

- Writing delay loops and reusable subroutines.  

- Converting C constructs (loops, arrays) into Assembly.  

- Using indirect addressing for array data access.  

- Hardware debugging with LEDs and logic analyzer.
