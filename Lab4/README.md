This lab expands on Assembly programming for the PIC18F4620, introducing arithmetic, logic, branching, and subroutine usage. Implement basic operations, test flags, and use subroutines selected by input switches to control LEDs.  

âœ… Lab Tasks  

1â€™s Complement (Part A) â€“ Read a 4-bit number from DIP switches (PORTA), compute its 1â€™s complement, and display on LEDs (PORTC).  

Zero Flag Test (Part B) â€“ Complement result checked with the Z flag; conditionally set/clear PORTD bit 1.  

Arithmetic & Logic Operations (Parts Câ€“F)  

  -Addition â€“ Input from PORTA + PORTB, result on PORTC with overflow shown on bit 4.  

  -AND, OR, XOR â€“ Replace addition with corresponding logical operations.  

BCD Conversion (Part G) â€“ Convert 4-bit input into BCD using comparison and conditional addition.  

Subroutines & Function Selection (Part H)  

  -Group each operation into subroutines (SUB_COMP, SUB_ADD, SUB_AND, SUB_OR, SUB_XOR, SUB_BCD).  

  -Use switches on PORTE bits [2:0] to select which routine to execute.  

  -RGB LED (PORTD bits 4â€“6) indicates the active operation.
